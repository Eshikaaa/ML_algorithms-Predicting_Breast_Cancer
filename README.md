# ML_algorithms-Predicting_Breast_Cancer
Breast cancer is a disease in which abnormal breast cells grow out of control and form tumours, affecting millions of women each year. Early detection plays a crucial role in improving survival rates and treatment outcomes. In recent years, machine learning techniques have emerged as valuable tools for assisting in the diagnosis and prediction.

Dataset Overview::
Took a dataset containing various features extracted from breast cancer biopsies, such as radius, texture, perimeter, area, and many. The dataset also includes the diagnosis column indicating whether the tumor is malignant (M) or benign (B).

Model Evaluation Metrics::
Evaluated the performance of each model using accuracy, which is ratio of Total correct instances to the total instances. . Additionally, computed other evaluation metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score to provide assessment of each model's performance.
